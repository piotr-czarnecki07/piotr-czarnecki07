# About me
I'm Piotr and I'm programming since I was 14 years old and I keep learning to this day. \
Currently I'm studing backend development from an amazing [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/backend) tutorial, and I'm also interested in topics like data science and AI/machine learning.

My biggest goal right now is to become a laureate or finalist of the Polish Informatics Olympiad for high schools.
